# The cel-spec protos are available on the BSR: https://buf.build/google/cel-spec/
#
# We do not use it, because we also rely on the conformance test data of the
# upstream repository (tests/simple/testdata). The BSR module does not have the
# full history, only tags.
#
# Instead, we fetch both the protos and the test data from the upstream repository
# (scripts/fetch-proto.js, scripts/fetch-testdata.js), which allows us to fetch
# both from arbitrary git references.
